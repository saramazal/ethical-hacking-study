# Preparation and Reconnaissance

**Define Scope and Rules of Engagement**
- Confirm the scope of testing and any restrictions.
- Obtain permission and follow the program's rules.

## **Passive Reconnaissance**
- Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information about a target without directly interacting with it, thereby minimizing the risk of detection. 
Here are some common passive reconnaissance tools: 

- [who.is](https://who.is/) - Tools like whois or online services that provide information about domain registration, ownership, and contact details.
- [theHarvester](https://www.kali.org/tools/theharvester/): Gathers email addresses, subdomains, and other information from public sources like search engines and PGP key servers.
- [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/): A search engine for internet-connected devices that reveals information about exposed services and vulnerabilities.
- [Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/): A data mining tool that creates graphical representations of relationships between information, useful for mapping out a targetâ€™s infrastructure.
- [Recon-ng](https://www.kali.org/tools/recon-ng/): A full-featured web reconnaissance framework with various modules for collecting information from public sources.
- [DNSenum](https://www.kali.org/tools/dnsenum/): A DNS recon and research tool that finds DNS records and maps the attack surface.
- [OSINT](https://osintframework.com/),  
- [Google](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/35890), 
- [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), 
- [wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/),

-  Social media.

## **Active Reconnaissance**

- Active reconnaissance tools are used to gather information about a target system or network by directly interacting with it. Here are some commonly used tools:

1. [**Nmap**](https://www.kali.org/tools/nmap/): A powerful network scanner used for discovering hosts, services, and vulnerabilities.

2. [**Nessus**](https://community.tenable.com/s/?language=en_US): A vulnerability scanner that identifies security flaws in systems and applications.

3. [**Nikto**](https://www.kali.org/tools/nikto/): A web server scanner that detects outdated software and configuration issues.

4. [**Metasploit**](https://www.metasploit.com/): A penetration testing framework that includes modules for scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities.

5. [**Netcat**](https://nmap.org/ncat/): A versatile networking tool for reading and writing data across network connections, often used for banner grabbing.

6. [**hping**](https://www.kali.org/tools/hping3/): A packet crafting tool used for network testing, including port scanning and firewall testing.
